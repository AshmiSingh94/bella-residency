          Lodging and food are basic amenities that basically every hostel
          provides. Besides the obvious facilities, parking space for bikes and
          scooters is available. We also have <b>solar heated water supply</b>,{" "}
          <b>laundry service</b>, a growing <b>library</b>, and while it is very{" "}
          <b>peaceful</b>, we are surprisingly close to the bazaar, and there is{" "}
          <b>easy access to vehicles on most routes</b>. Because the wardens
          stay in the hostel, <b>safety</b> is assured.&nbsp; Owned by a mother
          of 2, alongside her husband, an educator with over 20 years of
          experience in counseling, teaching and management, Parmeshworee stands
          out when it comes to the care, the <b>priority of education</b>,{" "}
          <b>relaxation</b>, and <b>ambience</b>. With space for{" "}
          <b>gardening</b>, a <b>swing</b>, ample <b>greenery</b>, and a{" "}
          <b>homely environment</b>, we try and provide as much peace for our
          students as we can.&nbsp;
